 * The income tax is calculated based on different tax brackets and rates.
 * If the gross income exceeds 50,000, an additional tax rate of 35% is applied.
 * The user is prompted to enter their gross monthly salary, and the program outputs the net monthly salary.
Great progress! Here are some important next steps and best practices for working with Git and Java projects:

1. **Creating New Files**  
 • Use git add <filename> to track new files.  
 • Organize code into packages (folders) for clarity (e.g., com.example.tax).

2. **Modifying Files**  
 • Make changes, then use git status to see what’s modified.  
 • Use git diff to review changes before committing.  
 • Commit often with clear messages (e.g., git commit -m "Refactor tax calculation logic").

3. **Good Standards**  
 • Write clear, descriptive commit messages.  
 • Use .gitignore to exclude build files, IDE configs, etc.  
 • Keep methods short and focused.  
 • Use meaningful variable and class names.  
 • Write comments for complex logic.  
 • Follow Java naming conventions (CamelCase for classes, lowerCamelCase for variables/methods).

4. **Branching Best Practices**  
 • Use feature branches for new features or bug fixes.  
 • Merge changes back to main after testing.  
 • Resolve conflicts carefully.

5. **Code Review & Collaboration**  
 • Push branches to remote (git push origin branch-name).  
 • Open pull requests for review if working with others.

6. **Testing**  
 • Write unit tests (e.g., with JUnit) for your code.  
 • Test before merging to main.
